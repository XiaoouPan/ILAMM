Description: A C++ implementation of I-LAMM algorithm to compute regularized Huber regression. 
             The choice of penalty functions includes the l1-norm (Lasso), the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and the minimax concave penalty (MCP).
             Two tuning parameters lambda (for penalty) and tau (for Huber loss) can be either user-specified or calibrated by k-fold cross-validation. 
             Other options include adding an intercept term into the model and modifying parameters in the I-LAMM algorithm.
